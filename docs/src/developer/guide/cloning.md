# Checking out the code

This section outlines the process of checking out the code for local development.

ðŸš© Make sure you have gone through the [Prerequisites Section](prerequisites.md) before following these notes.

Git Code check out [PROJECT_URL] <!-- Change this per project -->

```
git clone https://github.com/project-name/repository.git
```
<!-- Change this to project repository -->

ðŸ“’**Which branch to use?**: Note that we deploy our staging work from the `develop` branch and our production environment from the `main` branch. If you are planning on contributing improvements to the project, please submit them against the `develop` branch.

ðŸª§ Now that you have the code checked out, move on to the [IDE Setup](ide-setup.md) documentation.
